# Simple JavaScript Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features:
- **Clear (AC)**: Resets the display to 0.
- **Delete (DE)**: Removes the last digit entered.
- **Decimal**: Adds a decimal point to the current number.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Equal**: Evaluates the expression entered.

## How to Run the Project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tadianazeemi04/js-calculator.git
     ```

   Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Extract Files** (if downloaded as a ZIP):

     ├── calculator.js     # JavaScript file for calculator functionality
     ├── README.md         # Project details and instructions
     ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**:
   - Simply double-click `index.html` or open it in your web browser.

4. **Use the Calculator**:
   - The calculator will display a basic user interface where you can start performing arithmetic operations.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For structuring the calculator's layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the calculator and adding responsive design features.
- **JavaScript**: For the calculator's logic, enabling arithmetic operations.

## Project Overview:
This simple calculator demonstrates the use of JavaScript for evaluating mathematical expressions and handling user inputs dynamically. It also includes a custom design using CSS.
